    <h2>Design Choices</h2>
    <p>Our chosen theme was centered around the beach, and was inspired by the metaphor of the island of knowledge which we read about in the Murray Textbook. This is reflected primarily in our choices of colors and pictures, as well as the welcome message and the seating chart island. </p>
    <p>We chose to make the color scheme and layout fairly simple, but we aimed to maximize usability in order to make the website as user friendly as possible. This was particularly important to us when designing the pages with iframes, such as submissions, grading, and past assignments. Our hope was to make the site fun, but above all easy to use. A few things to point out on this matter:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            We made the iframe bigger and fixed it next to the comments and assignment description for ease of viewing your own past work with comments, as well as for grading and assessing the work of peers. 
        </li>
        <li>
            We added a dividing line (using a border) between the work done out of class and work done in class all in each of the day boxes to create easy visual separation. 
        </li>
        <li>
            We added a hover effect so that assignments and navigation links were highlighted.
        </li>
        <li>
            We increased the text size in many cases to increase readability.
        </li>
        <li>
            Our color schemes, background, images, and effects are all relatively simple and subtle because ease of use was prioritized over looks in all cases. 
        </li>
    </ul>
